# ft_printf

ft_printf is a 42 project that consists of recreating the C function printf, the main objective is to learn about programming a function similar to printf and its inner workings, also learn about memory management, error handling and implementation of different types of conversion. This project is an excellent opportunity to learn about the handling of standard C functions and improve skills in C programming and code optimization.

# How to use it

This function behaves in the same way as the printf function of the stdio.h library.

```
ft_printf("", ...);
```
